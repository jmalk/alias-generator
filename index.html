            Many websites require you to use your real name when creating an account. But for those that don't you may want a quirky nickname. And why go to the hassle of creating one yourself when you could just use our funky name generator! Sure, you <em>could</em> just pick a random adjective and a random noun, then smush them together yourself. But we've automated the process for you!

                If you're curious about aliases and online identity, I recommend having a look at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/19/aleks-krotoski-online-identity-turkle">Aleks Krotoski's article on the matter</a> as a starting point.
